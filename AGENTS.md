This is an implementation of FC-CLIP, an open-vocabulary segmentation model based on the implementation of Mask2Former.

Running tests on this repo is not possible in your test environment because you need CUDA and other heavy dependencies, so don't bother installing anything. Just try to write correct code to the best of your ability; your work will be tested later.
